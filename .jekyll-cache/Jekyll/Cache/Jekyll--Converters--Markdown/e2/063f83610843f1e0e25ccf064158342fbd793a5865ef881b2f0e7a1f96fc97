I"j<p>Hi, I’m William “Will” McDowell. I started this blog as a means to codify some of the worthwhile things I’ve learned. Most of the topics will have a Personal Finance, Productivity or Technology focus, but I reserve the right to throw in any other random topic of interest.</p>

<p>I was born in Oregon, but after well over 35+ years we call South Texas home. A home that includes my lovely wife, three sons, three dogs and two horses! Yes all Texans have horses!</p>

<p>I’ve have had a varied career thus far pretty much all while working at the same fortune 100 company. While most of my career has been in the Technology field, I have an undergraduate in Political Science and am a <a href="https://certificates.cfp.net/68642c81-a85e-4230-bb17-879f1a1119c7">CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you find the topics interesting and helpful.</p>
